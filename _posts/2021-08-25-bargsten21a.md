abstract: Using intracoronary imaging modalities like intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
  has a positive impact on the results of percutaneous coronary interventions. Efficient
  extraction of important vessel metrics like lumen diameter, vessel wall thickness
  or plaque burden via automatic segmentation of IVUS images can improve the clinical
  workflow. State-of-the-art segmentation results are usually achieved by data-driven
  methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, clinical data sets are
  often rather small leading to extraction of image features which are not very meaningful
  and thus decreasing performance. This is also the case for some applications which
  inherently allow for only small amounts of available data, e.g., detection of diseases
  with extremely small prevalence or online-adaptation of an existing algorithm to
  individual patients. In this work we investigate how integrating scattering transformations
  - as special forms of wavelet transformations - into CNNs could improve the extraction
  of meaningful features. To this end, we developed a novel network module which uses
  features of a scattering transform for an attention mechanism. We observed that
  this approach improves the results of calcium segmentation up to 8.2% (relatively)
  in terms of the Dice coefficient and 24.8% in terms of the modified Hausdorff distance.
  In the case of lumen and vessel wall segmentation, the improvements are up to 2.3%
  (relatively) in terms of the Dice coefficient and 30.8% in terms of the modified
  Hausdorff distance.Incorporating scattering transformations as a component of an
  attention block into CNNs improves the segmentation results on small IVUS segmentation
  data sets. In general, scattering transformations can help in situations where efficient
  feature extractors can not be learned via the training data. This makes our attention
  module an interesting candidate for applications like few-shot learning for patient
  adaptation or detection of rare diseases.
