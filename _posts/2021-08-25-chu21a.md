abstract: We introduce the concept of multi-task learning to weakly-supervised lesion
  segmentation, one of the most critical and challenging tasks in medical imaging.
  Due to the lesionsâ€™ heterogeneous nature, it is difficult for machine learning models
  to capture the corresponding variability. We propose to jointly train a lesion segmentation
  model and a lesion classifier in a multi-task learning fashion, where the supervision
  of the latter is obtained by clustering the RECIST measurements of the lesions.
  We evaluate our approach specifically on liver lesion segmentation and more generally
  on lesion segmentation in computed tomography (CT), as well as segmentation of skin
  lesions from dermatoscopic images. We show that the proposed joint training improves
  the quality of the lesion segmentation by 4% percent according to the Dice coefficient
  and 6% according to averaged Hausdorff distance (AVD), while reducing the training
  time required by up to 75%.
