abstract: 'Motivation: Traditional image attribution methods struggle to satisfactorily
  explain predictions of neural networks. Prediction explanation is important, especially
  in medical imaging, for avoiding the unintended consequences of deploying AI systems
  when false positive predictions can impact patient care. Thus, there is a pressing
  need to develop improved models for model explainability and introspection.  Specific
  problem: A new approach is to transform input images to increase or decrease features
  which cause the prediction. However, current approaches are difficult to implement
  as they are monolithic or rely on GANs. These hurdles prevent wide adoption. Our
  approach: Given an arbitrary classifier, we propose a simple autoencoder and gradient
  update (Latent Shift) that can transform the latent representation of a specific
  input image to exaggerate or curtail the features used for prediction. We use this
  method to study chest X-ray classifiers and evaluate their performance. We conduct
  a reader study with two radiologists assessing 240 chest X-ray predictions to identify
  which ones are false positives (half are) using traditional attribution maps or
  our proposed method. Results: We found low overlap with ground truth pathology masks
  for models with reasonably high accuracy. However, the results from our reader study
  indicate that these models are generally looking at the correct features. We also
  found that the Latent Shift explanation allows a user to have more confidence in
  true positive predictions compared to traditional approaches (0.15$\pm$0.95 in a
  5 point scale with p=0.01) with only a small increase in false positive predictions
  (0.04$\pm$1.06 with p=0.57). Accompanying webpage: https://mlmed.org/gifsplanation/
