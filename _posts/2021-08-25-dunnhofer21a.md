abstract: This paper presents MRPyrNet, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
  that improves the capabilities of CNN-based pipelines for knee injury detection
  via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Existing works showed that anomalies are localized
  in small-sized knee regions that appear in particular areas of MRI scans. Based
  on such facts, MRPyrNet exploits a Feature Pyramid Network to enhance small appearing
  features and Pyramidal Detail Pooling to capture such relevant information in a
  robust way. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate
  that MRPyrNet improves the ACL tear and meniscal tear diagnosis capabilities of
  two state-of-the-art methodologies. Code is available at https://git.io/JtMPH.
