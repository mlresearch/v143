abstract: Intensity of acquired electron microscopy data is subjected to large variability
  due to the interplay of many different factors, such as microscope and camera settings
  used for data acquisition, sample thickness, specimen staining protocol and more.
  In this work, we developed an efficient method for performing intensity inhomogeneity
  correction on a single set of combined transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
  and demonstrated its positive impact on training a neural network on these data.
  In addition, we investigated what impact different intensity standardization methods
  have on the training performance, both for data originating from a single source
  as well as from several different sources. As a concrete example, we considered
  the problem of segmenting mitochondria from EM data and demonstrated that we were
  able to obtain promising results when training our network on a large array of highly-variable
  in-house TEM data.
