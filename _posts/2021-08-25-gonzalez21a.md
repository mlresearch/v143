abstract: The segmentation of cardiac structures in Cine Magnetic Resonance imaging
  (CMR) plays an important role in monitoring ventricular function, and many deep
  learning solutions have been introduced that successfully automate this task. Yet
  due to variabilities in the CMR acquisition process, images from different centers
  or acquisition protocols differ considerably. This causes deep learning models to
  fail silently. It is therefore crucial to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
  for which the trained model is unsuitable. For models with a self-supervised proxy
  task, we propose a simple method to identify OOD samples that does not require adapting
  the model architecture or access to a separate OOD dataset during training. As the
  performance of self-supervised tasks can be assessed without ground truth information,
  it indicates during test time when a sample differs from the training distribution.
  The proposed method combines a voxel-wise uncertainty estimate with the self-supervision
  information. Our approach is validated across three CMR datasets and two different
  proxy tasks. We find that it is more effective at detecting OOD samples than state-of-the-art
  post-hoc OOD detection and uncertainty estimation approaches.
