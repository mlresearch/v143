abstract: With in-line holography, it is possible to record biological cells over
  time in a three-dimensional hydrogel without the need for staining, providing the
  capability of observing cell behavior in a minimally invasive manner. However, this
  setup currently requires computationally intensive image-reconstruction algorithms
  to determine the required cell statistics. In this work, we directly extract cell
  positions from the holographic data by using deep neural networks and thus avoid
  several reconstruction steps. We show that our method is capable of substantially
  decreasing the time needed to extract information from the raw data without loss
  in quality.
