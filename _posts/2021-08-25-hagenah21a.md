abtract: 'In personalized prosthesis shaping, the desired shape remains typically
  unknown and has to be estimated based on the individual pathological shape. This
  estimation is also called pseudo healthy synthesis. One example application is the
  personalization of aortic root prostheses during valve-sparing aortic root surgery.
  Even though several methods for pseudohealthy synthesis were proposed during the
  last years, it might not always be necessary to taylor a completely individual and
  unique prosthesis for each and every patient as this introduces high costs and regulatory
  issues. Another option is to identify a set of prosthesis types that represents
  all natural healthy shapes in an adequate way. Then, the pseudohealthy synthesis
  problem becomes a classification problem, aiming on predicting the optimal prosthesis
  out of the set of candidates given a pathological shape. In this work, we present
  a fully automized workflow of unsupervised shape typification and type classification
  based on pathological data for the example of personalizing aortic root prostheses
  shapes. We provide a proof-of-concept study on an ex-vivo porcine data set, including
  a thorough evaluation of the model''s hyperparameters and the number of identified
  shape types. Our study lies the groundwork for a new branch of personalized prosthesis
  shaping with a high potential of translation to clinical application: Discrete Pseudohealthy
  Synthesis.'
