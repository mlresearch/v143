abstract: Weakly supervised segmentation is an important problem in medical image
  analysis due to the high cost of pixelwise annotation. Prior methods, while often
  focusing on weak labels of 2D images, exploit few structural cues of volumetric
  medical images. To address this, we propose a novel weakly-supervised segmentation
  strategy capable of better capturing 3D shape prior in both model prediction and
  learning. Our main idea is to extract a self-taught shape representation by leveraging
  weak labels, and then integrate this representation into segmentation prediction
  for shape refinement. To this end, we design a deep network consisting of a segmentation
  module and a shape denoising module, which are trained by an iterative learning
  strategy. Moreover, we introduce a weak annotation scheme with a hybrid label design
  for volumetric images, which improves model learning without increasing the overall
  annotation cost. The empirical experiments show that our approach outperforms existing
  SOTA strategies on three organ segmentation benchmarks with distinctive shape properties.
  Notably, we can achieve strong performance with even 10% labeled slices, which is
  significantly superior to other methods.
