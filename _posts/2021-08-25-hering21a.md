abstract: In follow-up CT examinations of cancer patients, therapy success is evaluated
  by estimating the change in tumor size. This process is time-consuming and error-prone.
  We present a pipeline that automates the segmentation and measurement of matching
  lesions, given a point annotation in the baseline lesion. First, a region around
  the point annotation is extracted, in which a deep-learning-based segmentation of
  the lesion is performed. Afterward, a registration algorithm finds the corresponding
  image region in the follow-up scan and the convolutional neural network segments
  lesions inside this region. In the final step, the corresponding lesion is selected.
  We evaluate our pipeline on clinical follow-up data comprising 125 soft-tissue lesions
  from 43 patients with metastatic melanoma. Our pipeline succeeded for $96%$ of the
  baseline and $80%$ of the follow-up lesions, showing that we have laid the foundation
  for an efficient quantitative follow-up assessment in clinical routine.
