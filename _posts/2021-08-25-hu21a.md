abstract: 'Artifacts, blur, and noise are the common distortions degrading MRI images
  during the acquisition process, and deep neural networks have been demonstrated
  to help in improving image quality. To well exploit global structural information
  and self-similarity details, we propose a novel MR image enhancement network, named
  Feedback Graph Attention Convolutional Network (FB-GACN). As a key innovation, we
  consider the global structure of an image by building a graph network from image
  sub-regions that we consider to be node features, linking them non-locally according
  to their similarity. The proposed model consists of three main parts: 1) The parallel
  graph similarity branch and content branch, where the graph similarity branch aims
  at exploiting the similarity and symmetry across different image sub-regions in
  low-resolution feature space and provides additional priors for the content branch
  to enhance texture details. 2) A feedback mechanism with a recurrent structure to
  refine low-level representations with high-level information and generate powerful
  high-level texture details by handling the feedback connections.  3) A reconstruction
  to remove the artifacts and recover super-resolution images by using the estimated
  sub-region self-similarity priors obtained from the graph similarity branch. We
  evaluate our method on two image enhancement tasks: i) cross-protocol super resolution
  of diffusion MRI; ii) artifact removal of FLAIR MR images. Experimental results
  demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.'
