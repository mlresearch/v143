abstract: 'Standard losses for training deep segmentation networks could be seen as
  individual classifications of pixels, instead of supervising the global shape of
  the predicted segmentations. While effective, they require exact knowledge of the
  label of each pixel in an image. This study investigates how effective global geometric
  shape descriptors could be, when used on their own as segmentation losses for training
  deep networks. Not only interesting theoretically, there exist deeper motivations
  to posing segmentation problems as a reconstruction of shape descriptors: First,
  annotations to obtain approximations of low-order shape moments could be much less
  cumbersome than their full-mask counterparts, and anatomical priors could be readily
  encoded into invariant shape descriptions, which might alleviate the annotation
  burden. Also, some shape descriptors could be readily used to “encode” biomarkers,
  leading to better interpretability. Finally, and most importantly, we hypothesize
  that, given a task, certain shape descriptions might be invariant across image acquisition
  protocols/modalities and subject populations, which might open interesting research
  avenues for generalization in medical image segmentation. We introduce and formulate
  a few shape descriptors in the context of deep segmentation, and evaluate their
  potential as stand-alone losses on two different, challenging tasks. Inspired by
  recent works in constrained optimization for deep networks, we propose a way to
  use those descriptors to supervise segmentation, without any pixel-level label.
  Very surprisingly, as little as 4 descriptors values per class can approach the
  performance of a segmentation mask with 65k individual discrete labels. We also
  found that shape descriptors can be a valid way to encode anatomical priors about
  the task, enabling to leverage expert knowledge without requiring additional annotations.
  Our implementation is publicly available and can be easily extended.'
