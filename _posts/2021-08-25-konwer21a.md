abstract: Automated analyses of chest imaging in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  have largely focused on a single timepoint, usually at disease presentation, and
  have not explicitly taken into account temporal disease manifestations. We present
  a deep learning-based approach for prediction of imaging progression from serial
  chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes convolutional
  neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within the concerned
  lung zone, and also from neighboring areas to enhance the contextual phenotypic
  information. The framework further incorporates two distinct spatio-temporal Long
  Short Term Memory (LSTM) modules for effective predictions. The first LSTM module
  captures spatial dependencies between patches and the second exploits the temporal
  context of sequential CXR scans. The resulting network focuses on critical image
  regions that provide relevant information for learning the progression of lung infiltrates
  without the explicit need for infiltrate segmentation. The second LSTM provides
  an encoded context vector used as an input to a decoder module to predict future
  severity grades. Our novel multi-institutional dataset comprises sequential CXR
  scans from N=100 patients. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease
  severity for a patient on the last day by learning representations from the previous
  temporal CXRs. We design two baseline approaches - one using fine-tuned VGG-16 features
  and the other using radiomic descriptors. Experimental results demonstrate that
  our proposed approach outperforms both baselines in average accuracy by 10.33% and
  12.16%, respectively, in predicting COVID-19 progression severity.
