abstract: 'Medical images are often accompanied by metadata describing the image (vendor,
  acquisition parameters) and the patient (disease type or severity, demographics,
  genomics). This metadata is usually disregarded by image segmentation methods. In
  this work, we adapt a linear conditioning method called FiLM (Feature-wise Linear
  Modulation) for image segmentation tasks. This FiLM adaptation enables integrating
  metadata into segmentation models for better performance. We observed an average
  Dice score increase of 5.1% on spinal cord tumor segmentation when incorporating
  the tumor type with FiLM. The metadata modulates the segmentation process through
  low-cost affine transformations applied on feature maps which can be included in
  any neural networkâ€™s architecture. Additionally, we assess the relevance of segmentation
  FiLM layers for tackling common challenges in medical imaging: training with limited
  or unbalanced number of annotated data, multi-class training with missing segmentations,
  and model adaptation to multiple tasks. Our results demonstrated the following benefits
  of FiLM for segmentation: FiLMed U-Net was robust to missing labels and reached
  higher Dice scores with few labels (up to 16.7%) compared to single-task U-Net.
  The code is open-source and available at www.ivadomed.org.'
