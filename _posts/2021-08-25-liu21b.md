abstract: In the last few years, deep learning classifiers have shown promising results
  in image-based medical diagnosis. However, interpreting the outputs of these models
  remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis, interpretability can be achieved by localizing
  the region of the input image responsible for the output, i.e. the location of a
  lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection models can be trained with pixel-wise
  annotations indicating the locations of malignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring
  such labels is labor-intensive and requires medical expertise. To overcome this
  difficulty, weakly-supervised localization can be utilized. These methods allow
  neural network classifiers to output saliency maps highlighting the regions of the
  input most relevant to the classification task (e.g. malignant lesions in mammograms)
  using only image-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not) during
  training. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce low-resolution
  saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which suspicious lesions are
  small in relation to the image size. In this work, we introduce a novel neural network
  architecture to perform weakly-supervised segmentation of high-resolution images.
  The proposed model selects regions of interest via coarse-level localization, and
  then performs fine-grained segmentation of those regions. We apply this model to
  breast cancer diagnosis with screening mammography, and validate it on a large clinically-realistic
  dataset. Measured by Dice similarity score, our approach outperforms existing methods
  by a large margin in terms of localization performance of benign and malignant lesions,
  relatively improving the performance by 39.6% and 20.0%, respectively. Code and
  the weights of some of the models are available at https://github.com/nyukat/GLAM
