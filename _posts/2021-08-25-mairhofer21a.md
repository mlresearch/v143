abstract: The quality of radiographs is of major importance for diagnosis and treatment
  planning. While most research regarding automated radiograph quality assessment
  uses technical features such as noise or contrast, we propose to use anatomical
  structures as more appropriate features. We show that based on such anatomical features,
  a modular deep-learning framework can serve as a quality control mechanism for the
  diagnostic quality of ankle radiographs. For evaluation, a dataset consisting of
  950 ankle radiographs was collected and their quality was labeled by radiologists.
  We obtain an average accuracy of 94.1%, which is better than the expert radiologists
  are on average.
