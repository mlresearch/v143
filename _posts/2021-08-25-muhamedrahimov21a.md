abstract: In classification, categories are typically treated as independent of one-another.
  In many problems, however, this neglects the natural relations that exist between
  categories, which are often dictated by an underlying biological or physical process.
  In this work, we propose novel formulations of the classification problem, aimed
  at reintroducing class relations into the training process. We demonstrate the benefit
  of these approaches for the classification of intravenous contrast enhancement phase
  in CT images, an important task in the medical imaging domain. First, we propose
  manual ways reintroduce knowledge about problem-specific interclass relations into
  the training process. Second, we propose a general approach to jointly learn categorical
  label representations that can implicitly encode natural interclass relations, alleviating
  the need for strong prior assumptions or knowledge. We show that these improvements
  are most significant for smaller training sets, typical in the medical imaging domain
  where access to large amounts of labelled data is often not trivial.
