abstract: 'Prior work demonstrated the ability of machine learning to automatically
  recognize surgical workflow steps from videos. However, these studies focused on
  only a single type of procedure. In this work, we analyze, for the first time, surgical
  step recognition on four different laparoscopic surgeries: Cholecystectomy, Right
  Hemicolectomy, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and Appendectomy. Inspired by the traditional
  apprenticeship model, in which surgical training is based on the Halstedian method,
  we paraphrase the “see one, do one, teach one” approach for the surgical intelligence
  domain as “train one, classify one, teach one”. In machine learning, this approach
  is often referred to as transfer learning. To analyze the impact of transfer learning
  across different laparoscopic procedures, we explore various time-series architectures
  and examine their performance on each target domain. We introduce a new architecture,
  the Time-Series Adaptation Network (TSAN), an architecture optimized for transfer
  learning of surgical step recognition, and we show how TSAN can be pre-trained using
  self-supervised learning on a Sequence Sorting task. Such pre-training enables TSAN
  to learn workflow steps of a new laparoscopic procedure type from only a small number
  of labeled samples from the target procedure. Our proposed architecture leads to
  better performance compared to other possible architectures, reaching over 90% accuracy
  when transferring from laparoscopic Cholecystectomy to the other three procedure
  types.'
