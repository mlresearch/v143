abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome the problem of imbalanced
  datasets for object detection tasks, when the distribution is not uniform over all
  classes. The general idea is to compute a probability vector, encoding the probability
  for each image to be fed to the network during the training phase. This probability
  vector is computed by solving some quadratic optimization problem and ensures that
  all classes are seen with similar frequency. We apply this method to a fetal anatomies
  detection problem, and conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the resulting
  performance to show that it performs significantly better than two baseline models:
  one with images sampled uniformly and one implementing classical oversampling.'
