abstract: Towards computer-assisted neurosurgery, robust methods for instrument localization
  on neurosurgical microscope video data are needed. Specifically for neurosurgical
  data, challenges arise from visual conditions such as strong blur and from an unknowingly
  large variety of instrument types. For neurosurgical domain, instrument localization
  methods must generalize across different sub-disciplines such as cranial tumor and
  aneurysm surgeries which exhibit different visual properties. We present and evaluate
  a methodology towards robust instrument tip localization for neurosurgical microscope
  data, formulated as coarse saliency prediction. For our analysis, we build a comprehensive
  dataset comprising in-the-wild data from several neurosurgical sub-disciplines as
  well as phantom surgeries. Comparing single stream networks using either image or
  optical flow information, we find complementary performance of both networks. Plain
  optical flow enables better cross-domain generalization, while the image-based network
  performs better on surgeries from the training domain. Based on these findings,
  we present a two-stream architecture that fuses image and optical flow information
  to utilize the complementary performance of both. Being trained on tumor surgeries,
  our architecture outperforms both single stream networks and shows improved robustness
  on data from different neurosurgical sub-disciplines. From our findings, future
  work must focus more on how to incorporate optical flow information into fusion
  architectures to further improve cross-domain generalization.
