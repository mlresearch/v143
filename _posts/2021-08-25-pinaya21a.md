abstract: Pathological brain appearances may be so heterogeneous as to be intelligible
  only as anomalies, defined by their deviation from normality rather than any specific
  pathological characteristic. Amongst the hardest tasks in medical imaging, detecting
  such anomalies requires models of the normal brain that combine compactness with
  the expressivity of the complex, long-range interactions that characterise its structural
  organisation. These are requirements transformers have arguably greater potential
  to satisfy than other current candidate architectures, but their application has
  been inhibited by their demands on data and computational resource. Here we combine
  the latent representation of vector quantised variational autoencoders with an ensemble
  of autoregressive transformers to enable unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation
  defined by deviation from healthy brain imaging data, achievable at low computational
  cost, within relative modest data regimes. We compare our method to current state-of-the-art
  approaches across a series of experiments involving synthetic and real pathological
  lesions. On real lesions, we train our models on 15,000 radiologically normal participants
  from UK Biobank, and evaluate performance on four different brain MR datasets with
  small vessel disease, demyelinating lesions, and tumours. We demonstrate superior
  anomaly detection performance both image-wise and pixel-wise, achievable without
  post-processing. These results draw attention to the potential of transformers in
  this most challenging of imaging tasks.
