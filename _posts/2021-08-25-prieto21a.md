abstract: Chlamydia trachomatous is an infectious ocular condition that can cause
  the eyelid to turn inward so that one or more eyelashes touch the eyeball, a condition
  call trachomatous trichiasis (TT), which can lead to blindness. Community-based
  screeners are used in rural areas to identify patients with TT, who can then be
  referred for proper medical care. Having automatic methods to detect TT will reduce
  the amount of time required to train screeners and improve accuracy of detection.
  This paper proposes a method to automatically identify regions of an eye and identify
  TT, using photographs taken with smartphones in the field. The attention-based gated
  deep learning networks in combination with a regionidentification network can identify
  TT with an accuracy of 91%, sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 87%, showing that
  these methods have the potential to be deployed in the field.
