abstract: We present a deep learning (DL) registration framework for fast mono-modal
  and multi-modal image registration using differentiable mutual information and diffeomorphic
  B-spline free-form deformation (FFD). Deep learning registration has been shown
  to achieve competitive accuracy and significant speedups from traditional iterative
  registration methods. In this paper, we propose to use a B-spline FFD parameterisation
  of Stationary Velocity Field (SVF) to in DL registration in order to achieve smooth
  diffeomorphic deformation while being computationally-efficient. In contrast to
  most DL registration methods which use intensity similarity metrics that assume
  linear intensity relationship, we apply a differentiable variant of a classic similarity
  metric, mutual information, to achieve robust mono-modal and multi-modal registration.
  We carefully evaluated our proposed framework on mono- and multi-modal registration
  using 3D brain MR images and 2D cardiac MR images.
