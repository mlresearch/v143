abstract: The contrast settings to select before acquiring magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) signal depend heavily on the subsequent tasks. As each contrast highlights
  different tissues, automated segmentation tools for example might be optimized for
  a certain contrast. While for radiotherapy, multiple scans of the same region with
  different contrasts can achieve a better accuracy for delineating tumours and organs
  at risk. Unfortunately, the optimal contrast for the subsequent automated methods
  might not be known during the time of signal acquisition, and performing multiple
  scans with different contrasts increases the total examination time and registering
  the sequences introduces extra work and potential errors. Building on the recent
  achievements of deep learning in medical applications, the presented work describes
  a novel approach for transferring any contrast to any other. The novel model architecture
  incorporates the signal equation for spin echo sequences, and hence the model inherently
  learns the unknown quantitative maps for proton density, $T1$ and $T2$ relaxation
  times ($PD$, $T1$ and $T2$, respectively). This grants the model the ability to
  retrospectively reconstruct spin echo sequences by changing the contrast settings
  Echo and Repetition Time ($TE$ and $TR$, respectively). The model learns to identify
  the contrast of pelvic MR images, therefore no paired data of the same anatomy from
  different contrasts is required for training. This means that the experiments are
  easily reproducible with other contrasts or other patient anatomies. Despite the
  contrast of the input image, the model achieves accurate results for reconstructing
  signal with contrasts available for evaluation. For the same anatomy, the quantitative
  maps are consistent for a range of contrasts of input images. Realized in practice,
  the proposed method would greatly simplify the modern radiotherapy pipeline. The
  trained model is made public together with a tool for testing the model on example
  images.
