abstract: Surgical workflow recognition has been playing an essential role in computer-assisted
  interventional systems for modern operating rooms. In this paper, we present a computer
  vision-based method named SWNet that focuses on utilizing spatial information and
  temporal information from the surgical video to achieve surgical workflow recognition.
  As the first step, we utilize Interaction-Preserved Channel-Separated Convolutional
  Network (IP-CSN) to extract features that contain spatial information and local
  temporal information from the surgical video through segments. Secondly, we train
  a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-TCN) with those extracted features
  to capture global temporal information from the full surgical video. Finally, by
  utilizing Prior Knowledge Noise Filtering (PKNF), prediction noise from the output
  of MS-TCN is filtered. We evaluate SWNet for Sleeve Gastrectomy surgical workflow
  recognition. SWNet achieves 90% frame-level accuracy and reaches a weighted Jaccard
  Score of 0.8256. This demonstrates that SWNet has considerable potential to solve
  the surgical workflow recognition problem.
