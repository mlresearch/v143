abstract: A Hybrid Optimization Between Iterative and network fine-Tuning (HOBIT)
  reconstruction method is proposed to solve quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)
  inverse problem in MRI. In HOBIT, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is first
  trained on healthy subjects’ data with gold standard labels. Domain adaptation to
  patients’ data with hemorrhagic lesions is then deployed by minimizing fidelity
  loss on the patient training dataset. During test time, a fidelity loss is imposed
  on each patient test case, where alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM)
  is used to split the time consuming fidelity imposed network update into iterative
  reconstruction and network update subproblems alternatively in ADMM, and only a
  subnet of the pre-trained CNN is updated during the process. Compared to the method
  FINE where such fidelity imposing strategy was initially proposed to solve QSM,
  HOBIT achieved both performance gain of reconstruction accuracy and vast reduction
  of computational time.
