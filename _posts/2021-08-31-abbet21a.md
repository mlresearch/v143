abstract: Supervised learning is conditioned by the availability of labeled data,
  which are especially expensive to acquire in the field of medical image analysis.
  Making use of open-source data for pre-training or using domain adaptation can be
  a way to overcome this issue. However, pre-trained networks often fail to generalize
  to new test domains that are not distributed identically due to variations in tissue
  stainings, types, and textures. Additionally, current domain adaptation methods
  mainly rely on fully-labeled source datasets. In this work, we propose Self-Rule
  to Adapt (SRA) which takes advantage of self-supervised learning to perform domain
  adaptation and removes the burden of fully-labeled source datasets. SRA can effectively
  transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained from a few labeled source domain
  to a new target domain without requiring additional tissue annotations. Our method
  harnesses both domainsâ€™ structures by capturing visual similarity with intra-domain
  and cross-domain self-supervision. We show that our proposed method outperforms
  baselines across diverse domain adaptation settings and further validate our approach
  to our in-house clinical cohort.
