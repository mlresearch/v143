abstract: 'Acute ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage in the cerebral arteries,
  resulting in long-term disability and sometimes death. To determine the optimal
  treatment strategy, a patient-specific assessment is often based on advanced neuroimaging
  data, such as spatio-temporal (4D) CT Perfusion (CTP) imaging. To date, perfusion
  maps are typically calculated from 4D CTP data and then thresholded to localize
  and quantify the stroke lesion core and tissue-at-risk. A few studies have recently
  developed deep learning methods to predict stroke lesion outcomes from perfusion
  maps. The basic idea of these is to train a model, using perfusion maps acquired
  at baseline and their corresponding follow-up images acquired several days after
  treatment, to automatically estimate the final lesion location and volume in new
  patients. Nevertheless, model training based on the original 4D CTP scans might
  be desirable, as they could contain more valuable information not directly represented
  in perfusion maps. Therefore, we aimed to develop and evaluate a temporal convolutional
  neural network (TCN) to predict stroke lesion outcomes directly from 4D CTP datasets
  acquired at admission, without computing any perfusion maps. Using a total of 176
  CTP scans, we investigated the impact of the time window size by training the proposed
  TCN on various numbers of CTP frames: 8, 16, and 32 time points. For comparison
  purposes, we also trained a convolutional neural network based on perfusion maps.
  The results show that the model trained on 32 time points yielded significantly
  higher Dice values (0.33$\pm$0.21) than the models trained on 8 time points (0.25$\pm$0.20;
  P$<$0.05), 16 time points (0.28$\pm$0.21; P$<$0.001), and perfusion maps (0.23$\pm$0.18;
  P$<$0.05). These experiments demonstrate that the proposed model effectively extracts
  spatio-temporal data from CTP scans to predict stroke lesion outcomes, which leads
  to better results than using perfusion maps.'
