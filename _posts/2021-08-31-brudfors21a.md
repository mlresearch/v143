abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by back-propagation have
  seen unprecedented success at semantic segmentation tasks, they are known to struggle
  on out-of-distribution data. Markov random fields (MRFs) on the other hand, encode
  simpler distributions over labels that, although less flexible than UNets, are less
  prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose to fuse both strategies by computing
  the product of distributions of a UNet and an MRF. As this product is intractable,
  we solve for an approximate distribution using an iterative mean-field approach.
  The resulting MRF-UNet is trained jointly by back-propagation. Compared to other
  works using conditional random fields (CRFs), the MRF has no dependency on the imaging
  data, which should allow for less over-fitting. We show on 3D neuroimaging data
  that this novel network improves generalisation to out-of-distribution samples.
  Furthermore, it allows the overall number of parameters to be reduced while preserving
  high accuracy. These results suggest that a classic MRF smoothness prior can allow
  for less over-fitting when principally integrated into a CNN model. Our implementation
  is available at https://github.com/balbasty/nitorch.
