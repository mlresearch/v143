abstract: We propose a semantic similarity metric for image registration. Existing
  metrics like euclidean distance or normalized cross-correlation focus on aligning
  intensity values, giving difficulties with low intensity contrast or noise. Our
  approach learns dataset-specific features that drive the optimization of a learning-based
  registration model. We train both an unsupervised approach using an auto-encoder,
  and a semi-supervised approach using supplemental segmentation data to extract semantic
  features for image registration. Comparing to existing methods across multiple image
  modalities and applications, we achieve consistently high registration accuracy.
  A learned invariance to noise gives smoother transformations on low-quality images.
