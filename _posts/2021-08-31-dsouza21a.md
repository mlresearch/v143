abstract: We propose a multimodal graph convolutional network (M-GCN) that integrates
  resting-state fMRI connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging tractography to predict
  phenotypic measures. Our specialized M-GCN filters act topologically on the functional
  connectivity matrices, as guided by the subject-wise structural connectomes. The
  inclusion of structural information also acts as a regularizer and helps extract
  rich data embeddings that are predictive of clinical outcomes. We validate our framework
  on 275 healthy individuals from the Human Connectome Project and 57 individuals
  diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder from an in-house data to predict cognitive
  measures and behavioral deficits respectively. We demonstrate that the M-GCN outperforms
  several state-of-the-art baselines in a five-fold cross validated setting and extracts
  predictive biomarkers from both healthy and autistic populations. Our framework
  thus provides the representational flexibility to exploit the complementary nature
  of structure and function and map this information to phenotypic measures in the
  presence of limited training data.
