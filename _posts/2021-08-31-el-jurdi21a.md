abstract: Deep convolutional networks recently made many breakthroughs in medical
  image segmentation. Still, some anatomical artefacts may be observed in the segmentation
  results, with holes or inaccuracies near the object boundaries. To address these
  issues, loss functions that incorporate constraints, such as spatial information
  or prior knowledge, have been introduced. An example of such prior losses are the
  contour-based losses, which exploit distance maps to conduct point-by-point optimization
  between ground-truth and predicted contours. However, such losses may be computationally
  expensive or susceptible to trivial local solutions and vanishing gradient problems.
  Moreover, they depend on distance maps which tend to underestimate the contour-to-contour
  distances. We propose a novel loss constraint that optimizes the perimeter length
  of the segmented object relative to the ground-truth segmentation. The novelty lies
  in computing the perimeter with a soft approximation of the contour of the probability
  map via specialized non-trainable layers in the network. Moreover, we optimize the
  mean squared error between the predicted perimeter length and ground-truth perimeter
  length. This soft optimization of contour boundaries allows the network to take
  into consideration border irregularities within organs while still being efficient.
  Our experiments on three public datasets (spleen, hippocampus and cardiac structures)
  show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art boundary losses for both
  single and multi-organ segmentation.
