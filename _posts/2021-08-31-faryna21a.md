abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are sensitive to domain shifts, which
  can result in poor generalization. In medical imaging, data acquisition conditions
  differ among institutions, which leads to variations in image properties and thus
  domain shift. Stain variation in histopathological slides is a prominent example.
  Data augmentation is one way to make CNNs robust to varying forms of domain shift,
  but requires extensive hyperparameter tuning. Due to the large search space, this
  is cumbersome and often leads to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this
  work, we focus on automated and computationally efficient data augmentation policy
  selection for histopathological slides. Building upon the RandAugment framework,
  we introduce several domain-specific modifications relevant to histopathological
  images, increasing generalizability. We test these modifications on H&E-stained
  histopathology slides from Camelyon17 dataset. Our proposed framework outperforms
  the state-of-the-art manually engineered data augmentation strategy, achieving an
  area under the ROC curve of 0.964 compared to 0.958, respectively.
