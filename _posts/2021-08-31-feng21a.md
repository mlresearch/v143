abstract: The tumor microenvironment is an area of intense interest in cancer research
  and may be a clinically actionable aspect of cancer care. One way to study the tumor
  microenvironment is to characterize the spatial interactions between various types
  of nuclei in cancer tissue from H&E whole slide images, which require nucleus segmentation
  and classification. Current methods of nucleus classification rely on extensive
  labeling from pathologists and are limited by the number of categories a nucleus
  can be classified into. In this work, leveraging existing nucleus segmentation and
  contrastive representation learning methods, we developed a method that learns vector
  embeddings of nuclei based on their morphology in histopathology images. We show
  that the embeddings learned by this model capture distinctive morphological features
  of nuclei and can be used to group them into meaningful subtypes. These embeddings
  can provide a much richer characterization of the statistics of the spatial distribution
  of nuclei in cancer and open new possibilities in the quantitative study of the
  tumor microenvironment.
