abstract: Ensuring the privacy of research participants is vital, even more so in
  healthcare environments. Deep learning approaches to neuroimaging require large
  datasets, and this often necessitates sharing data between multiple sites, which
  is antithetical to the privacy objectives. Federated learning is a commonly proposed
  solution to this problem. It circumvents the need for data sharing by sharing parameters
  during the training process. However, we demonstrate that allowing access to parameters
  may leak private information even if data is never directly shared. In particular,
  we show that it is possible to infer if a sample was used to train the model given
  only access to the model prediction (black-box) or access to the model itself (white-box)
  and some leaked samples from the training data distribution. Such attacks are commonly
  referred to as \textit{Membership Inference attacks}. We show realistic Membership
  Inference attacks on deep learning models trained for 3D neuroimaging tasks in a
  centralized as well as decentralized setup. We demonstrate feasible attacks on brain
  age prediction models (deep learning models that predict a personâ€™s age from their
  brain MRI scan). We correctly identified whether an MRI scan was used in model training
  with a 60% to over 80% success rate depending on model complexity and security assumptions.
