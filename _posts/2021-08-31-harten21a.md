abstract: Motility of the small intestine is a valuable metric in the evaluation of
  gastrointestinal disorders. Cine-MRI of the abdomen is a non-invasive imaging technique
  allowing evaluation of this motility. While 2D cine-MR imaging is increasingly used
  for this purpose in both clinical practice and in research settings, the potential
  of 3D cine-MR imaging has been largely underexplored. In the absence of image analysis
  tools enabling investigation of the intestines as 3D structures, the assessment
  of motility in 3D cine-images is generally limited to the evaluation of movement
  in separate 2D slices. Hence, to obtain an untangled representation of the small
  intestine in 3D cine-MRI, we propose a method to extract a centerline of the intestine,
  thereby allowing easier (visual) assessment by human observers, as well as providing
  a possible starting point for automatic analysis methods quantifying peristaltic
  bowel movement along intestinal segments. The proposed method automatically tracks
  individual sections of the small intestine in 3D space, using a stochastic tracker
  built on top of a CNN-based orientation classifier. We show that the proposed method
  outperforms a non-stochastic iterative tracking approach.
