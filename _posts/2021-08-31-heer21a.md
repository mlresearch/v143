abstract: Deep unsupervised generative models are regarded as a promising alternative
  to supervised counterparts in the field of MRI-based lesion detection. They denote
  a principled approach for detecting unseen types of anomalies without relying on
  large amounts of expensive ground truth annotations. To this end, deep generative
  models are trained exclusively on data from healthy patients and detect lesions
  as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data at test time (i.e. low likelihood). While this
  is a promising way of bypassing the need for costly annotations, this work demonstrates
  that it also renders this widely used unsupervised anomaly detection approach particularly
  vulnerable to non-lesion-based OOD data (e.g. data from different sensors). Since
  models are likely to be exposed to such OOD data in production, it is crucial to
  employ safety mechanisms to filter for such samples and run inference only on input
  for which the model is able to provide reliable results. We first show extensively
  that conventional, unsupervised anomaly detection mechanisms fail when being presented
  with true OOD data. Secondly, we apply prior knowledge to disentangle lesion-based
  OOD from their non-lesion-based counterparts.
