abstract: Digital pathology has enabled us to capture, store and analyze scanned biopsy
  samples as digital images. Recent advances in deep learning are contributing to
  computational pathology to improve diagnosis and treatment. However, considering
  challenges inherent to whole slide images (WSIs), it is not easy to employ deep
  learning in digital pathology. More importantly, computational bottlenecks induced
  by the gigapixel WSIs make it difficult to use deep learning for end-to-end image
  representation. To mitigate this challenge, many patch-based approaches have been
  proposed. Although patching WSIs enables us to use deep learning, we end up with
  a bag of patches or set representation which makes downstream tasks non-trivial.
  More importantly, considering set representation per WSI, it is not clear how one
  can obtain similarity between two WSIs (sets) for tasks like image search matching.
  To address this challenge, we propose a neural network based on Convolutions Neural
  Network (CNN) and Deep Sets to learn one permutation invariant vector representation
  per WSI in an end-to-end manner. Considering available labels at the WSI level -
  namely, primary site and cancer subtypes - we train the proposed network in a multi-label
  setting to encode both primary site and diagnosis. Having in mind that every primary
  site has its own specific cancer subtypes, we propose to use the predicted label
  for the primary site to recognize the cancer subtype. The proposed architecture
  is used for transfer learning of WSIs and validated two different tasks, i.e., search
  and classification. The results show that the proposed architecture can be used
  to obtain WSI representations that achieve better performance both in terms of retrieval
  performance and search time against \emph{Yottixel}, a recently developed search
  engine for pathology images. Further, the model achieved competitive performance
  against the state-of-art in lung cancer classification.
