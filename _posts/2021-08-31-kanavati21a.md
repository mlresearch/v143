abstract: 'Transfer learning from ImageNet is the go-to approach when applying deep
  learning to medical images. The approach is either to fine-tune a pre-trained model
  or use it as a feature extractor. Most modern architecture contain batch normalisation
  layers, and fine-tuning a model with such layers requires taking a few precautions
  as they consist of trainable and non-trainable weights and have two operating modes:
  training and inference. Attention is primarily given to the non-trainable weights
  used during inference, as they are the primary source of unexpected behaviour or
  degradation in performance during transfer learning. It is typically recommended
  to fine-tune the model with the batch normalisation layers kept in inference mode
  during both training and inference. In this paper, we pay closer attention instead
  to the trainable weights of the batch normalisation layers, and we explore their
  expressive influence in the context of transfer learning.  We find that only fine-tuning
  the trainable weights (scale and centre) of the batch normalisation layers leads
  to similar performance as to fine-tuning all of the weights, with the added benefit
  of faster convergence. We demonstrate this on a variety of seven publicly available
  medical imaging datasets, using four different model architectures.'
