abstract: Age-related morphological brain changes are known to be different in healthy
  and disease-affected aging. Biological brain age estimation from MRI scans is a
  common way to quantify this effect whereas differences between biological and chronological
  age indicate degenerative processes. The ability to visualize and analyze the morphological
  age-related changes in the image space directly is essential to improve the understanding
  of brain aging. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning based approach to
  unify biological brain age estimation and age-conditioned template creation in a
  single, consistent model. We achieve this by developing a deterministic autoencoder
  that successfully disentangles age-related morphological changes and subject-specific
  variations. This allows its use as a brain age regressor as well as a generative
  brain aging model. The proposed approach demonstrates accurate biological brain
  age prediction, and realistic generation of age-conditioned brain templates and
  simulated age-specific brain images when applied to a database of more than 2000
  subjects.
