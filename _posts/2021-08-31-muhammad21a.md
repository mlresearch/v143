abstract: Histopathology-based survival modelling has two major hurdles. Firstly,
  a well-performing survival model has minimal clinical application if it does not
  contribute to the stratification of a cancer patient cohort into different risk
  groups, preferably driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting, individuals
  are not given specific prognostic predictions, but are rather predicted to lie within
  a risk group which has a general survival trend. Thus, It is imperative that a survival
  model produces well-stratified risk groups. Secondly, until now, survival modelling
  was done in a two-stage approach (encoding and aggregation). EPIC-Survival bridges
  encoding and aggregation into an end-to-end survival modelling approach, while introducing
  stratification boosting to encourage the model to not only optimize ranking, but
  also to discriminate between risk groups. In this study we show that EPIC-Survival
  performs better than other approaches in modelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
  (ICC), a historically difficult cancer to model. We found that stratification boosting
  further improves model performance and helps identify specific histologic differences,
  not commonly sought out in ICC.
