abstract: Deep learning in medical image analysis often requires an extensive amount
  of high-quality labeled data for training to achieve Human-level accuracy. We propose
  Gist-set Online Active Learning (GOAL), a novel solution for limited high-quality
  labeled data in medical imaging analysis. Our approach advances the existing active
  learning methods in three aspects. Firstly, we improve the classification performance
  with fewer manual annotations by presenting a sample selection strategy called gist
  set selection. Secondly, unlike traditional methods focusing only on random uncertain
  samples of low prediction confidence, we propose a new method in which only informative
  uncertain samples are selected for human annotation. Thirdly, we propose an application
  of online learning where high-confidence samples are automatically selected, iteratively
  assigned, and pseudo-labels are updated. We validated our approach on two private
  and one public dataset. The experimental results show that, by applying GOAL, we
  can reduce required labeled data up to 88% while maintaining the same F1 scores
  compared to the models trained on full datasets
