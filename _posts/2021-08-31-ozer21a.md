abstract: Medical image quality assessment is an important aspect of image acquisition
  where poor-quality images may lead to misdiagnosis. In addition, manual labelling
  of image quality after the acquisition is often tedious and can lead to some misleading
  results. Despite much research on the automated analysis of image quality for tackling
  this problem, relatively little work has been done for the explanation of the methodologies.
  In this work, we propose an explainable image quality assessment system and validate
  our idea on foreign objects in a Chest X-Ray (Object-CXR) dataset. Our explainable
  pipeline relies on NormGrad, an algorithm, which can efficiently localize the image
  quality issues with saliency maps of the classifier. We compare our method with
  a range of saliency detection methods and illustrate the superior performance of
  NormGrad by obtaining a Pointing Game accuracy of 0.862 on the test dataset of the
  Object-CXR dataset. We also verify our findings through a qualitative analysis by
  visualizing attention maps for foreign objects on X-Ray images.
