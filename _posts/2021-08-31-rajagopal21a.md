abstract: Fully-convolutional neural networks, such as the 2D or 3D UNet, are now
  pervasive in medical imaging for semantic segmentation, classification, image denoising,
  domain translation, and reconstruction. However, evaluation of UNet performance,
  as with most CNNs, has mostly been relegated to evaluation of a few performance
  metrics (e.g. accuracy, IoU, SSIM, etc.) using the networkâ€™s final predictions,
  which provides little insight into important issues such as dataset shift that occur
  in clinical application. In this paper, we propose techniques for understanding
  and visualizing the generalization performance of UNets in image classification
  and regression tasks, giving rise to metrics that are indicative of performance
  on a withheld test-set without the need for groundtruth annotations.
