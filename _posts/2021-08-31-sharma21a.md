abstract: 'In recent years, the availability of digitized Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
  has enabled the use of deep learning-based computer vision techniques for automated
  disease diagnosis. However, WSIs present unique computational and algorithmic challenges.
  WSIs are gigapixel-sized ($\sim$100K pixels), making them infeasible to be used
  directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often only slide-level labels
  are available for training as detailed annotations are tedious and can be time-consuming
  for experts. Approaches using multiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been
  shown to overcome these challenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the
  learning framework into two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN)
  for encoding the patches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level
  prediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the representations
  learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end framework that clusters
  the patches from a WSI into ${k}$-groups, samples ${k}â€™$ patches from each group
  for training, and uses an adaptive attention mechanism for slide level prediction;
  Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have demonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters
  can improve the model training by exposing it to diverse discriminative features
  extracted from the patches. We regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing
  a KL-divergence loss between the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the
  uniform distribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level cross-entropy,
  patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss.'
