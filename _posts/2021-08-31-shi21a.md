abstract: We systematically evaluate the performance of deep learning models in the
  presence of diseases not labeled for or present during training. First, we evaluate
  whether deep learning models trained on a subset of diseases (seen diseases) can
  detect the presence of any one of a larger set of diseases. We find that models
  tend to falsely classify diseases outside of the subset (unseen diseases) as ‘no
  disease”. Second, we evaluate whether models trained on seen diseases can detect
  seen diseases when co-occurring with diseases outside the subset (unseen diseases).
  We find that models are still able to detect seen diseases even when co-occurring
  with unseen diseases. Third, we evaluate whether feature representations learned
  by models may be used to detect the presence of unseen diseases given a small labeled
  set of unseen diseases. We find that the penultimate layer provides useful features
  for unseen disease detection. Our results can inform the safe clinical deployment
  of deep learning models trained on a non-exhaustive set of disease classes.
