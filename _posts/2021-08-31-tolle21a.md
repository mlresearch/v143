abstract: Exploiting the deep image prior property of convolutional auto-encoder networks
  is especially interesting for medical image processing as it avoids hallucinations
  by omitting supervised learning. Its spectral bias towards lower frequencies makes
  it suitable for inverse image problems such as denoising and super-resolution, but
  manual early stopping has to be applied to act as a low-pass filter. In this paper,
  we present a novel Bayesian approach to deep image prior using mean-field variational
  inference. This allows for uncertainty quantification on a per-pixel level and,
  given the right prior distribution on the network weights, omits the need for early
  stopping. We optimize the parameters of the weight prior towards reconstruction
  accuracy using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Process regression. We evaluate
  our approach on different inverse tasks on a variety of modalities and demonstrate
  that an optimized weight prior outperforms former state-of-the-art Bayesian deep
  image prior approaches. We show that a badly selected prior leads to worse accuracy
  and calibration and that it is sufficient to optimize the weight prior parameter
  per task domain.
