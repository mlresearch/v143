abstract: The excessive deposition of misfolded proteins such as amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)
  protein is an aging event underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Mounting
  evidence shows that the spreading of neuropathological burden has a strong association
  to the white matter tracts in the brain which can be measured using diffusion-weighted
  imaging and tractography technologies. Most of the previous studies analyze the
  dynamic progression of amyloid using cross-sectional data which is not robust to
  the heterogeneous A$\beta$ dynamics across the population. In this regard, we propose
  a graph neural network-based learning framework to capture the disease-related dynamics
  by tracking the spreading of amyloid across brain networks from the subject-specific
  longitudinal PET images. To learn from limited (2 – 3 timestamps) and noisy longitudinal
  data, we restrict the space of amyloid propagation patterns to a latent heat diffusion
  model which is constrained by the anatomical connectivity of the brain. Our experiments
  show that restricting the dynamics to be a heat diffusion mechanism helps to train
  a robust deep neural network for predicting future time points and classifying Alzheimer’s
  disease brain.
