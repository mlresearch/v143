abstract: Diffeomorphic and deforming autoencoders have been recently explored in
  the field of medical imaging for appearance and shape disentanglement. Both models
  are based on the deformable template paradigm, however they show different weaknesses
  for the representation of medical images. Diffeomorphic autoencoders only consider
  spatial deformations, whereas deforming autoencoders also regard changes in the
  appearance, however no uniform template is generated for the whole training dataset,
  and the appearance is modeled depending on a very few parameters. In this work,
  we propose a method that represents images based on a global template, where next
  to the spatial displacement, the appearance is modeled as the pixel-wise intensity
  difference to the unified template. To however ensure that the generated appearance
  offsets adhere to the template shape, a guided filter smoothing of the appearance
  map is integrated into an end-to-end training process. This regularization significantly
  improves the disentanglement of shape and appearance and thus enables multi-modal
  image modeling. Furthermore, the generated templates are crisper and the registration
  accuracy improves. Our experiments also show applications of the proposed approach
  in the field of automatic population analysis.
