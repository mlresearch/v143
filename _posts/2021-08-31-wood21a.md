abstract: The growing demand for head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations,
  along with a global shortage of radiologists, has led to an increase in the time
  taken to report head MRI scans around the world.  For many neurological conditions,
  this delay can result in increased morbidity and mortality.  An automated triaging
  tool could reduce reporting times for abnormal examinations by identifying abnormalities
  at the time of imaging and prioritizing the reporting of these scans.  In this work,
  we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting clinically-relevant
  abnormalities in T2-weighted head MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report
  classifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK hospitals
  for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area under the receiver
  operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans labelled by a team of
  neuroradiologists.  Importantly, when trained on scans from only a single hospital
  the model generalized to scans from the other hospital (delta AUC <= 0.02).  A simulation
  study demonstrated that our model would reduce the mean reporting time for abnormal
  scans from 28 days to 14 days and from 9 days to 5 days at the two hospitals, demonstrating
  feasibility for use in a clinical triage environment.
