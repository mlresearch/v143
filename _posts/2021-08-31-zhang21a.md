abstract: 'To develop deep learning-based models for automatic analysis of histopathology
  whole slide images (WSIs), the atomic entities to be directly processed are often
  the smaller patches cropped from WSIs as it is not always possible to feed a whole
  WSI to a model given its enormous size. However, a trained model tends to relate
  the slide-specific characteristics to diagnosis results because a large number of
  patches cropped from the same WSI will share common slide features and thus have
  strong correlations between them, resulting in deteriorated generalization capability
  of the trained model. Current approaches to alleviate this issue include data pre-processing
  (stain normalization or color augmentation) and adversarial learning, both of which
  introduce extra complications in computations. Alternatively, we propose to reduce
  the impact of this issue by introducing a new regularization term to the standard
  loss function to reduce the correlation of the patches from the same WSI. It is
  intuitive and easy-to-implement and introduces comparably smaller computation overhead
  compared to existing approaches. Experimental results prove that the proposed regularization
  term is able to enhance the generalization capability of learning models and consequently
  to achieve better performance. The code is available in: \url{https://github.com/hrzhang1123/SlideCorrelationReduction}.'
